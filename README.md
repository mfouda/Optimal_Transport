> Hi, this repository is aimed to record my personal progresses and plan on the research of O.T.\
> I think the most helpful part for you may be the **Awesome Materials on Optimal Transport**, where I have maken some comments to help you choose the most suitable material.

# Awesome Materials on Optimal Transport

### Introductory Materials / Tutorials / Textbooks
| Materials  | Comments (Possibly Helpful) |
|---|---|
| [Introduction to Optimal Transport](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~mthorpe/OTNotes) | This introduction is full of theorems and proofs, which are based on some definitions and theorems from rigorous probability theory, functional analysis and convex analysis. In addition, it doesn't mention Sinkhorn's Algorithm, Barycenters, and some other latest topics. [[Mindmap]](./images/Mindmap_Intro_ot.png) |
| [Computational Optimal Transport](https://optimaltransport.github.io/)  | The slide is not complete in some sections, so it is better to read the corresponding book. [[Book]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.00567.pdf)  [[Codes]](https://github.com/optimaltransport/optimaltransport.github.io/tree/master/code)  [[Slides]](https://optimaltransport.github.io/slides-peyre/CourseOT.pdf) |
| [A Primer on Optimal Transport](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/ScheduleMultitrack?event=8736) | This is a tutorial of O.T. in NIPS2017 which can give an overall outline about the research of O.T. up to 2017. |
