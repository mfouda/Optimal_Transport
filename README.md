# Awesome Materials on Optimal Transport

### Introductory Materials / Tutorials
| Materials  | Comments (Possibly Helpful) |
|---|---|
| [Introduction to Optimal Transport](http://www.math.cmu.edu/~mthorpe/OTNotes) | This introduction is full of theorems and proofs, which are based on some definitions and theorems from rigorous probability, functional analysis and convex analysis. In addition, it doesn't mention Sinkhorn's Algorithm, Barycenters, and some other latest topics. |
| [Computational Optimal Transport](https://optimaltransport.github.io/)  | This may be the best introductory material to O.T. [Update after reading]  |
| [A Primer on Optimal Transport](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/ScheduleMultitrack?event=8736) | This is a tutorial of O.T. in NIPS2017 which can give an overall outline about the research of O.T. up to 2017. |
