# Research on Optimal Transport
I am very honored to have Prof. [Chao Chen](https://boole.cs.qc.cuny.edu/cchen/) to supervise me on the research of optimal transport. This repository is aimed to record my progresses and schedule my plan on the research.

### Schedule
02/17 - 02/23:
- [ ] Review the whole introduction

02/10 - 02/16:
- [ ] 02/16 Finish the 5th chapter
- [ ] 02/14 Finish the 4th chapter
